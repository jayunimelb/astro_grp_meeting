Dear all,

This email is to inform that you are selected as organiser and speakers for the group meeting to be held 4 weeks later (http://qyx268.github.io/astromeeting_site/)

Here are the details:
date: 10. April 2017
Organiser:	Jack Line (j.line@student.unimelb.edu.au)
speakers:	Edoardo Tescari (edoardo.tescari@unimelb.edu.au) and Dylan Sutton (d.sutton@student.unimelb.edu.au)

Please note that each speaker needs to give a talk (around 10 minutes) during the astro-group meeting.
If possible, please prepare your talk 8 days before your due date, just in case the previous meeting needs your backup.

And it will be the organiser's responsibility to update the group meeting minutes on AstroWiki and to serve a cake after the meeting 

If you can't make it please let me know within this friday, otherwise you will need to find an alternative by yourself.

Regards,
Sanjay
