Hi Edoardo,

You are selected to be the chair for the group meeting to be held 4 weeks later (http://qyx268.github.io/astromeeting_site/)

Here are the details:
date: 19. December 2016
chair:	Edoardo Tescari (edoardo.tescari@unimelb.edu.au)
speaker:	Stephanie Bernard (sbernard@student.unimelb.edu.au)

Please
	1) supervise the speaker on preparing the talk, 
	2) remind the astro group that you are the chair and collect agendas from them on Monday, 
	3) send an announcement to the astro-people about 15 minutes before the group meeting, 
	4) update the group meeting minutes on AstroWiki,
	5) prepare a cake (usually) on Wednesday afternoon. 

I'm not sure if we will have group meeting on 19/Dec/16. But still please let me know if you could make it just in case we will have one :)

If you become unable to attend the meeting after this Friday, unfortunately, you will need to find an alternative by yourself.
If you only need to give a 15-minute talk but you are the only speaker selected, let me know and I will arrange one more speaker.

Cheers,
Yuxiang
