Dear all,
This email is to inform that you are selected either as an organiser or as a speaker for the group meeting to be held 4 weeks later (i.e on Monday 29. May 2017)
Here are the details:
Date: 29. May 2017
Organiser:	James Davies 
Speakers:	Jack Lonnbron and  Paul Geil

Please note that each speaker needs to give a talk (around 10 minutes) during the astro-group meeting. If possible, please prepare your talk 8 days before your due date, just in case the previous meeting needs your backup
.
And it will be the organiser's responsibility to update the group meeting minutes on AstroWiki and to serve a cake after the meeting

If you can't make it please let me know within this friday (i,e ), otherwise you will need to find an alternative by yourself

Cheers,
Sanjay
