Hi there,

You are selected to be the chair and speaker(s) for the group meeting to be held NEXT YEAR (http://qyx268.github.io/astromeeting_site/)

Here are the details:
date: 20. Feb  2017
chair:	Craig Burnett (c.burnett@student.unimelb.edu.au)
speaker:	Ling Sun (lings2@student.unimelb.edu.au)

Please note that it will be the speaker's duty to prepare a talk (less than 30 minutes) on the astro-group meeting.
If possible, please finish your slice 8 days before your due date, just in case the previous meeting needs your backup :)

And it will be the chair's responsibility to
	1) supervise the speaker on preparing the talk, 
	2) remind the astro group that you are the chair and collect agendas from them on Monday, 
	3) send an announcement to the astro-people about 15 minutes before the group meeting, 
	4) update the group meeting minutes on AstroWiki,
	5) prepare a cake (usually) on Wednesday afternoon. 

Please confirm it by replying me or let me know as soon as possible if you cannot make it :)

If you become unable to attend the meeting after this Friday, unfortunately, you will need to find an alternative by yourself.
If you only need to give a 15-minute talk but you are the only speaker selected, let me know and I will arrange one more speaker.

Cheers,
Yuxiang
