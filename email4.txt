Hi Paul,

Sory for the late notice. The speaker for the group meeting to be held 4 weeks lateri just told me that he would not be able to give a talk on that day. You are selected to be the speaker instead (http://qyx268.github.io/astromeeting_site/)

Here are the details:
date: 14. November 2016
chair:	Ricardo D'Amico (r.d'amico@student.unimelb.edu.au)
speaker:	Paul Geil (geil.p@unimelb.edu.au)

Please let me know if it is also not a proper time for you. Again I'm sorry for the late notice.

Cheers,
Yuxiang
