Hi Sri,

You are selected to be the chair for the group meeting to be held 4 weeks later (http://qyx268.github.io/astromeeting_site/)

Here are the details:
date: 26. September 2016
chair:	Srinivasan Raghunathan (srinivasan.raghunathan@unimelb.edu.au)
speaker:	Chiara Tonini (chiara.tonini@unimelb.edu.au)

Please note that it will be the chair's responsibility to
	1) supervise the speaker on preparing the talk, 
	2) remind the astro group that you are the chair and collect agendas from them on Monday, 
	3) send an announcement to the astro-people about 15 minutes before the group meeting, 
	4) update the group meeting minutes on AstroWiki,
	5) prepare a cake (usually) on Wednesday afternoon. 

Let me know as soon as possible if you cannot make it :)
If you become unable to attend the meeting after this Friday, unfortunately, you will need to find an alternative by yourself.

Cheers,
Yuxiang
