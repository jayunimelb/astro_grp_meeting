Dear all,

You are selected to be the chair and speakers for the group meeting to be held 4 weeks later (http://qyx268.github.io/astromeeting_site/)

Here are the details:
date: 20. March 2017
chair:	Chiara Tonini (chiara.tonini@unimelb.edu.au)
speaker1:	Andrew Melatos (amelatos@unimelb.edu.au)
speaker2:	Clare Kenyon (ckenyon@student.unimelb.edu.au)

Please note that each speaker needs to give a talk (around 10 minutes) on the astro-group meeting.
If possible, please finish your slice 8 days before your due date, just in case the previous meeting needs your backup :)

And it will be the chair's responsibility to
	1) supervise the speakers on preparing the talks, 
	2) remind the astro group that you are the chair and collect agendas from them on Monday, 
	3) send an announcement to the astro-people about 15 minutes before the group meeting, 
	4) update the group meeting minutes on AstroWiki,
	5) serve a cake after the meeting 

Please let me know as soon as possible if you cannot make it :)

After this Friday, you will need to find an alternative by yourself.

Cheers,
Yuxiang
