Dear all,
This email is to inform that you are selected either as an organiser or as a speaker for the group meeting to be held 4 weeks later (i.e on Monday 19. June 2017)
Here are the details:
Date: 19. June 2017
Organiser:	Hansik Kim 
Speakers:	Sinem Ozbilgen and  Noura Alonzi

Please note that each speaker needs to give a talk (around 10 minutes) during the astro-group meeting. If possible, please prepare your talk 8 days before your due date, just in case the previous meeting needs your backup
.
And it will be the organiser's responsibility to update the group meeting minutes on AstroWiki and to serve a cake after the meeting

If you can't make it please let me know within i,e Friday 26. May 2017, otherwise you will need to find an alternative by yourself

Cheers,
Sanjay
