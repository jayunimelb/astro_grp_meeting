Dear all,
This email is to inform that you are selected either as an organiser or as a speaker for the group meeting to be held 4 weeks later (i.e on Monday 19. March 2018)
Here are the details:
Date: 19. March 2018
Organiser:	Anh Pham 
Speakers:	Simon Mutch and  Michele Trenti

Please note that each speaker needs to give a talk (around 10 minutes) during the astro-group meeting. If possible, please prepare your talk 8 days before your due date, just in case the previous meeting needs your backup
.
And it will be the organiser's responsibility to update the group meeting minutes on AstroWiki and to serve a cake after the meeting

If you can't make it please let me know within i,e Friday 23. February 2018, otherwise you will need to find an alternative by yourself

Cheers,
Sanjay
