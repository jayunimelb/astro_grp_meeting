Hi there,

Please allow me to remind you that you are the chair and speaker(s) for next week. (http://qyx268.github.io/astromeeting_site/)

Here are the details:
date: 30. May 2016
chair:	Cameron Van Der Velden (c.vandervelden@student.unimelb.edu.au)
speaker:	Craig Burnett (c.burnett@student.unimelb.edu.au)

Please note that it will be the speaker's duty to prepare a talk (less than 30 minutes) on the astro-group meeting.

And it will be the chair's responsibility to
	1) supervise the speaker on preparing the talk, 
	2) remind the astro group that you are the chair and collect agendas from them on Monday, 
	3) send an announcement to the astro-people about 15 minutes before the group meeting, 
	4) update the group meeting minutes on AstroWiki,
	5) prepare a cake (usually) on Wednesday afternoon. 

If you have swapped with other people, please forward this email :)

Cheers,
Yuxiang
