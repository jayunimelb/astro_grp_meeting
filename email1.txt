Hi all,

Let me remind you that you are the chair and speaker(s) for next week. (http://qyx268.github.io/astromeeting_site/)

Here are the details:
date: 22. February 2016
chair:	None
speaker:	None

Please note that it will be the speaker's duty to prepare a talk on the astro-group meeting.

And it will be the chair's responsibility to
	1) supervise the speaker on preparing the talk, 
	2) remind the astro group that you are the chair and collect agendas from them on Monday, 
	3) send an announcement to the astro-people about 15 minutes before the group meeting, 
	4) prepare a cake (usually) after the colloquium on Wednesday. 

If you have swapped with other people, please forward this email :)

Cheers,
Yuxiang
