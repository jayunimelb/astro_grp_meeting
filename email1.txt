Hi there,

Please allow me to remind you that you are the chair and speaker(s) for next week. (http://qyx268.github.io/astromeeting_site/)

Here are the details:
date: 27. June 2016
chair:	Yisheng Qiu (yishengq@student.unimelb.edu.au)
speaker:	Anthea King (anthea.king@unimelb.edu.au)

Please note that it will be the speaker's duty to prepare a talk (less than 30 minutes) on the astro-group meeting.

And it will be the chair's responsibility to
	1) supervise the speaker on preparing the talk, 
	2) remind the astro group that you are the chair and collect agendas from them on Monday, 
	3) send an announcement to the astro-people about 15 minutes before the group meeting, 
	4) update the group meeting minutes on AstroWiki,
	5) prepare a cake (usually) on Wednesday afternoon. 

If you will be unable to attend the meeting but did not let me know when I sent you the previous email about 3 weeks ago, you need to find an alternative by yourself.
If you have swapped with other people, please forward this email :)

Cheers,
Yuxiang
