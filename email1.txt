Dear all,

Please allow me to remind you that you are the chair and speakers for next week. (http://qyx268.github.io/astromeeting_site/)

Here are the details:
date: 13. March 2017
chair:	Edoardo Tescari (edoardo.tescari@unimelb.edu.au)
speaker1:	Simon Mutch (smutch@unimelb.edu.au)
speaker2:	Mohit Bhardwaj (mohitb@student.unimelb.edu.au)

Please note that each speaker needs to give a talk (around 10 minutes) on the astro-group meeting.

And it will be the chair's responsibility to
	1) supervise the speakers on preparing the talks, 
	2) remind the astro group that you are the chair and collect agendas from them on Monday, 
	3) send an announcement to the astro-people about 15 minutes before the group meeting, 
	4) update the group meeting minutes on AstroWiki,
	5) serve a cake after the meeting 

If you will be unable to attend the meeting, please find an alternative.
If you have swapped with other people, please forward this email :)

Cheers,
Yuxiang
